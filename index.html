			<p><em>Hidden Figures</em>, written by Margot Lee Shetterly, tells the story of four African-American women who worked as computers at NASA and its predecessor, NACA (National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics), in the 20th century. In the 1940s, during World War II, NACA began hiring African-American women due to a lack of qualified white workers. While these women played key roles in American spaceflight programs, they were often given sup-par pay and titles compared to their white male counterparts.</p>
			<p>Dorothy Vaughan, Katherine Johnson, Mary Jackson, and Christine Darden were all highly skilled mathematicians and made significant contributions to the space program. Despite their accomplishments, they often faced discrimination and segregation and did not receive credit for their work until decades later.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Dorothy Vaughan was the first African-American woman to be promoted to the position of supervisor at NACA. When digital computers started to become commonplace, and human computers began being phased out, she taught her staff FORTRAN, one of the first programming languages, to ensure they would keep their jobs.</li>
				<li>Katherine Johnson was well-known for her ability to solve complex mathematical problems. She calculated the trajectories for many of the first American space flights, including the launch of Alan Shepard, the first American to go to space.</li>
				<li>Mary Jackson started out her career as a computer, before eventually becoming the first African-American woman to be promoted to engineer. Much of her career was spent in the background as a diversity manager, where she helped many other women to be hired or promoted.</li>

			<h3>History of "human computers"</h3>

			<span class="caption">Predicting the path of Halley's Comet was one of the first practical uses of human computers.</span>
			<p>The first woman computer was Nicole-Reine Lepaute, who in the 1750s worked to calculate the return date for Halley's Comet. After months of work, she concluded that the comet would return between March and May the following year. While the calculations weren't perfect, an important innovation was discovered: splitting calculations into many smaller parts would allow many people to work on the same problem in parallel. Computers became more popular in the 19th century, as scientists began collecting large amounts of data. Women were hired as computers mainly because they could be paid less than men: they were often paid half the wage of men, even though they were doing the same work.</p>
			<p>Computing was viewed as menial labour, even though it included doing complex calculations and required strong mathematical proficiency. The job necessitated a high level of precision and persistence, as they had to do the same tedious calculations for hours at a time. Throughout the remainder of the 1800s, computing remained an obscure profession, used mainly in astronomy, for calculating the paths of planets, asteroids, and comets, and classifying stars.</p>
			<p>The 20th century heralded two major changes: education levels were rising, which meant women were able to receive more schooling; and the outbreak of war meant there was a higher demand for computers. In the First World War, the United States Army hired women to calculate trajectories for artillery shells. Computing, unlike most other jobs of the time, was open to women, minorities, and even disabled polio survivors. Demand for computers grew even higher during World War II and the space race that followed. Around this time, the first digital computers were being built; however, they were expensive and took significant amounts of time to program. Additionally, many people were skeptical of computers and preferred humans to do the calculations themselves: for example, John Glenn, the third American astronaut in space, personally asked Katherine Johnson to verify the flight path for his mission.</p>
			<h3>Women in STEM</h3>

			<span class="caption">The ENIAC was the world's first general-purpose digital computer.</span>
			<p>While engineering and computer science are now heavily male-dominated fields, they weren't always this way. The first programmers who worked with the ENIAC computer in the 1940s and 50s were women, and the first algorithm was created by Ada Lovelace a century before. The switch from a female-dominated industry to a male-dominated one can be traced back to two psychologists—William Cannon and Dallis Perry—who, in the 1960s, conducted a study to determine the "ideal" programmer. Out of the study's 1,400 participants, fewer than 200 were women. The study concluded that the best programmer was someone who was antisocial, and preferred computers over people. This had the effect of creating the "nerd" stereotype, and in the following several decades, women were gradually pushed out of the industry.</p>
			<p>Over the past several decades, women's participation in the labour force has risen dramatically, and they now account for around half of the total workforce. However, the opposite is true for engineering and computer science: between 1984 and 2019, the proportion of computer science majors who were women dropped from 36% to 18%. This decrease can be attributed to a number of factors, including the stereotype of male programmers created by Cannon and Perry's study.</p>
			<p>Efforts have been made in recent years to attempt to reverse this downwards trend. Many organizations have been created—for example, the National Center for Women and Information Technology in the United States—which are dedicated to getting more women interested in STEM and increasing diversity in the field. While some progress has been made, there's still a lot more to go.</p>
